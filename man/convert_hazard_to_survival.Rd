\title{Convert Instantaneous Hazard Rates to Survival Curve}
\usage{
convert_hazard_to_survival(hazard_rates)
}
\arguments{
\item{hazard_rates}{A numeric vector of hazard rates.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of survival probabilities corresponding to the input
hazard rates.
}
\description{
This function converts a vector of hazard rates into a survival curve.
The survival probability at each time point is calculated based on the
cumulative sum of the hazard rates up to that point.
}
\details{
The relationship between the hazard rates and the survival probabilities is
given by:
\deqn{S(t) = \exp(-\sum_{i=1}^{t} h_i)}
where \eqn{S(t)} is the survival probability at time \eqn{t}, and \eqn{h_i}
is the hazard rate at time \eqn{i}.

# Example hazard rates

# Convert hazard rates to survival probabilities
