\title{Convert Hazard Rate to Probability}
\usage{
convert_hazard_to_probability(v_hazard_rate, time_unit = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{v_hazard_rate}{A numeric value or vector representing the hazard rates.}

\item{time_unit}{A numeric value representing the length of the time unit
over which the hazard rate is applied. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A numeric value or vector of probabilities corresponding to the input
hazard rates.
}
\description{
This function converts a hazard rate to the probability of an event occurring
within a specified time unit. The conversion uses the exponential
relationship between hazard rates and survival probabilities.
}
\details{
The relationship is given by the formula:
\deqn{p = 1 - \exp(-h \cdot \Delta t)}
where \eqn{p} is the probability of the event occurring within the time unit,
\eqn{h} is the hazard rate, and \eqn{\Delta t} is the length of the time
unit.

This formula assumes a constant hazard rate over the specified time period.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example hazard rate (per year)
hazard_rate <- 0.05

# Time unit in years
time_unit <- 1

# Convert hazard rate to probability
event_probability <- convert_hazard_to_probability(hazard_rate, time_unit)

event_probability

# Example with a vector of hazard rates
hazard_rates <- c(0.01, 0.02, 0.03)
event_probabilities <- convert_hazard_to_probability(hazard_rates, time_unit)
